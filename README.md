flightzilla
=====

Idea
-----

flightzilla will assist in an environment, where it is not possible to use enterprise-software and bugzilla is not more suitable, e.g.:

- handle houndreds of tickets
- deal with a dozen of team-members
- deal with a dozen of commits each day

- TBD

Usage:
-----

flightzilla requires a installed Zend-Framework 1.12/trunk in its include path. flightzilla can use mergy (https://github.com/hpbuniat/mergy), to execute simple merges.
